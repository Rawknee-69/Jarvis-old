Question : moving along x-axis is given by x = a + bt2 
Answer : This equation describes motion along the x-axis where a is the initial position, b is the acceleration, and t is the time.
Question : where a = 8.5 m, b = 2.5 m sï¿½2 and t is 
Answer : The position of the object at time t is given by x = 8.5 + 2.5t2.
Question : measured in seconds. What is its velocity at 
Answer : The velocity of the object at time t is given by v = 2.5t.
Question : t = 0 s and t = 2.0 s. What is the average 
Answer : The average velocity of the object over the time interval from t = 0 s to t = 2.0 s is given by v = (2.5t + 2.5(2.0-0))/2.0 = 2.5 m/s.
Question : velocity between t = 2.0 s and t = 4.0 s ?  
Answer : The average velocity of the object over the time interval from t = 2.0 s to t = 4.0 s is given by v = (2.5t + 2.5(4.0-2.0))/2.0 = 3.75 m/s.
Question : Can velocity be negative 
Answer : Yes, velocity can be negative. Velocity is a vector quantity, so it has both magnitude and direction. The direction of velocity can be either positive or negative, depending on the direction of motion.
Question : is kinematics important for JEE 
Answer : Kinematics is one of the important topics for JEE. It is a branch of physics that deals with the description of motion, without reference to the forces that cause it.
Question : Hydrogen gas is not evolved when most of the metals react with nitric acid. why? 
Answer : Hydrogen gas is not evolved when most of the metals react with nitric acid because the metals are not strong enough to reduce the nitric acid to nitrogen gas.
