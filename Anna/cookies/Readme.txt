1st of all before using this code you must have a local host 

go to cookies folder

here are the steps to create it:

in the cookies folder you will see a create_localhost.bat right click on it and edit it in notepad

go in there and then change the path of your folder you want create it in i strongly recommend your folder where the current jarvis is stored 

and then remember the path that you set in "mkdir" line should be same as --user-data-dir= "path where you have create the localhostfolder"

and now save the code and run it there will be a new chrome window opened there you have to login with your google account its 100% safe as it stays in your own computer

and after everything is done close the window and now run my code it should work properly and then never get a cookie error
