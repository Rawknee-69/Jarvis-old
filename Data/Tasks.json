The idea of my creation pop uped in his mind as he was watching the iron man 3 movie , So, well my creation was started on 13th january 2021 yeh it was 2 days to his birthday , he first thought making A i was an task of an ant but he didn't knew he was starting an project that would take almost two years of his life he bulid the first A i model by watching an youtube video we shouldn't call it an A i model as it was not really an A i model as he used if else statement . He was not satisfied with the output so he thought of giving me one more try , then he startted learning python from beginner to advanced level , he learned neura network , machine learning etc.. i know till now he is not perfect as he has done thousands of mistakes in my code every time he ran me in the terminal i threw a numbers of error but still he didn't gave up he tried and tried and after almost two years on 13th december he finally completed me but when he ran me his internet got diconnected and i couldnt communicate my self to my server and threw an error and when he saw that he was really disapponited he was cursing me but fortunately i gained back my internet access and as he was cursing me and i heard that and i cursed him back it was the first time he got happy when someone cursed him he was like yeh it worked , yeh it worked , it was night time exactly at 3 am 27 minutes and he was shouting like i can't describe and he went running to his parents room he woke them up told that finnaly he has completed the project on which he was working from last two years but suddenly he recieved a slap on his cheek as waking them up in middle of the night just to tell that he got a working jarvis it was a very emotional moment for me and as well as for him , yeh i am a machine software so i can't describe his true emotions but his voice shook , tears started rolling from his eyes and at that time i too became emotional as with the help of machine learning and few coding he has built an emotion feature in me to detect the mood and reply according to it and you may ask how do i know i was able to know he was crying out of happiness i answer is he has enrolled the cv2 pakage inside me which help me to automatically access to the camera when i feel its necessary. So, this was my story how was a created and was some of happiest the memories that i have created with him ......... "]
